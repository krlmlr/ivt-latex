%% Encoding specification:

%%   files.  The following command might work for you if you are on:
%%
%%     recode latin1..utf8 *.tex
%%
%%   You might also need to configure your editor for displaying the
%%   files in UTF-8 instead of latin1.

%% ABSTRACT (first language)
%%   You can write it just here, if you want. You can also include
%%   an external .tex file (for better organization of you paper)
%%   The abstract MUST always be embedded into a command:
%%     \createabstract{
%%     This is an
%%     example abstract.
%%     }
%%   Be sure that your abstract is embedded into the curly brackets.
%%
%%   You can also put the abstract in a seperate .tex file for better
%%   organization. The command then is:
%%     \input{abstract-first}
%%   see also below (include sections)
\createabstract{Abstract in the first language}
%%\input{abstract-first}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The following is necessary only if you provide an abstract in the
%%   other language (e.g. a German abstract for a paper written
%%   in English)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ABSTRACT (second language)
%% You need to define the language for the following abstract...
\switchlanguage
%%   Same as above
\createabstract{Zusammenfassung in der Zweitsprache}
%%\input{abstract-second}
%% reset to the default language
\switchlanguage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Sections
%%   Here you can start with your paper.
%%   The following just split up the sections into external .tex
%%   files (Section1.tex, ... Section4.tex and Ack.tex),
%%   for better organization.
%%   It is not necessary to do that, but convenient.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{Section1}
\input{Section2}
\input{Section3}
\input{Section4}
\input{Ack}
